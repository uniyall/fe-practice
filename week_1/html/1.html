        Kaiju Cafe was created in 1999 as a half-hatched plan that Erika Lee
        came up with while awaiting Y2K. She watched too many monster movies on
        Sunday afternoons. Later, she had a child obsessed with large creatures
        with sharp teeth, which was fitting.

        The restaurant originally offered vegetarian and vegan food. However,
        many disappointed visitors expected meat to be on the menu. The internet
        offers mixed opinions about kaiju diets, but there seems to be some
        consensus that there’s a kaiju to eat just about anything. Therefore,
        burgers made it on the menu, in addition to big salads and Erika’s
        famous chocolate cake.

        I'm not saying I don't enjoy the days that I'm not eating chocolate
        cake. But I do particularly like those days when I am eating chocolate
        cake.
